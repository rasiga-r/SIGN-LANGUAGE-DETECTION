<h1>About Sign Language Recognition</h1>
<p>
    This application uses computer vision techniques with MediaPipe and OpenCV to recognize
    hand gestures corresponding to common sign language signals. The system detects hand landmarks,
    analyzes finger positions, and maps them to meaningful phrases to assist in communication.
</p>
<p>
    The gestures recognized include simple signs like "Okay", "Dislike", "Victory", "Stop", "Point", "Love", "No", and "Miss You".
    These have been mapped to natural language meanings to help non-signers understand the conveyed message.
</p>
<p>
    This project aims to bridge communication gaps and promote accessibility using AI-powered tools.
